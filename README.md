# register-dimensioning
 Scripts to obtain structural dimensioning complying with different registers

The notebooks in this repository are written during the execution of a university project (20 meters aluminium planing yacht) so I picked up only the formulas useful for my type of boat; they are not complete to be used for the dimensioning of a generic vessel. It is my intention to expand this work completing with the remaining formulas contained in the classification rules, also with a more clear interface and with stored coefficients that permit to use the code without looking directly at the rule.
